        <h2>What is E-Waste?</h2>
        <p>
          Electronic waste, commonly referred to as e-waste, encompasses
          discarded electronic devices and electrical equipment. These devices
          include but are not limited to old computers, laptops, mobile phones,
          televisions, printers, and household appliances like refrigerators and
          microwaves.
        </p>

        <h2>Why E-Waste Recycling Matters</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Environmental Impact:</strong> Electronic devices contain
            various hazardous materials such as lead, mercury, cadmium, and
            flame retardants. Improper disposal of e-waste can lead to these
            toxic substances leaching into the soil and water, posing serious
            environmental and health risks to humans and wildlife.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Resource Conservation:</strong> Many electronic devices
            contain valuable materials such as gold, silver, copper, and rare
            earth metals. Recycling e-waste allows for the recovery and reuse of
            these resources, reducing the need for new raw materials and
            minimizing the environmental impact of mining and extraction
            processes.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Energy Conservation:</strong> Recycling e-waste consumes
            less energy compared to manufacturing new products from raw
            materials. By recycling electronic devices, we conserve energy and
            reduce greenhouse gas emissions associated with manufacturing
            processes.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Data Security:</strong> Proper e-waste recycling includes
            secure data destruction methods to ensure that sensitive information
            stored on electronic devices is permanently erased, protecting
            individuals and businesses from potential data breaches and identity
            theft.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Why Recycle E-Waste?</h2>
        <p>
          Electronic waste, or e-waste, poses significant environmental and
          health risks when not disposed of properly. Electronics contain
          hazardous materials such as lead, mercury, and cadmium, which can
          leach into soil and water, contaminating the environment and
          endangering human health. By recycling e-waste, we can prevent these
          harmful substances from polluting our planet and conserve valuable
          resources.
